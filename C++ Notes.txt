USE STD::ANY AND STD::ANY_CAST WHEN READING PACKETS IN STEAMWORKS
static_cast, reinterpet cast
SHOULD USE UNIQUE_PTR INSTEAD OF RAW BULLSHIT OR REF/SCOPE :D
UTF8 is enough for fonts and shit
When shooting just shoot immediately on locally and ignore when network packet comes in
Use enums for packet id's

State Replication = variables (Health)
Event Replication = functions (Unit spawned)
